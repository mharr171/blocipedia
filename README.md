# Blocipedia
Blocipedia is a Wikipedia replica built with Ruby on Rails. Blocipedia allows
users to sign up, in, and out. All registered users may create public 'wikis'
that can be viewed and edited by all other registered users. Users can also
upgrade their accounts by paying via Stripe, giving them the ability to create
private 'wikis' where they can curate a list of approved collaborators that may
also edit their private 'wiki'. Blocipedia also comes with admin user abilities,
giving admins access to manipulate all content on the site.
